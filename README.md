How To Install Java and Maven:

1. Install the Java 8 Development Kit (a.k.a. JDK) for your operating system (link). For detailed instructions on compiling from source, go here
2. Install Maven using your Linux distribution’s package manager. For Debian based systems (e.g., Ubuntu) read this and for RedHat read this
3. Open a new command-prompt and run mvn -version to confirm that it’s working. If it is, it will list the application and its version information. If it’s not working, it will display an error that should help you debug what’s wrong
4. Download and unzip an initial Maven project directory structure (with pre-loaded dependency file) from here.
